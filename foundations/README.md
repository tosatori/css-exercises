These Exercises are part of the Odin Project, and are the first exercises concerning the styling of web pages with css.


By solving these exercises I learnt about basic css settings like color, background-color, font-size, alignment, font-weight, adjusting image dimensions and furthermore about internal and external styling, using class and id selectors, grouping and chaining selectors, the descendant combinator and the cascade of css.
